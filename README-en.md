## Project Goal

1- The objective of this project is to create a digital textual database for the revitalization of Cameroonian local languages. This is to allow students and teachers captivated by artificial intelligence, text analysis, and language enhancement through AI to use it. Thus, it can be used in the context of a master's thesis, the teaching of Natural Language Processing in universities, and the development of applications and sophisticated translation systems. These endangered languages will be reborn from the ashes. Baptized Project Sueza, this is an open-source project. Anyone who wishes to contribute with their knowledge of computer science, literature, or other subjects is welcome. 

2- From the dataset collected, a dataset containing stoping words for a given language is going to be built. we will then construct the R/python package to perform stopping word extraction in Cameroonian languages written texts. 

3- We need to develop a database of traditional Cameroonian dishes with annotations. The annotation will be in a variety of languages to allow deep learning enthusiasts to use it to train models that can detect and identify our different dishes.
