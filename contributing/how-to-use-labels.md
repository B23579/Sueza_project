### Labels
Labels can help you find an issue you'd like to help with.
- The [`help wanted` label](https://github.com/B23579/Sueza_project/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) 
is for problems or updates that anyone in the project community can start working on.
- The [`good first issue` label](https://github.com/B23579/Sueza_project/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) 
is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
- The [`content` label](https://github.com/B23579/Sueza_project/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acontent) is for problems or updates
in the content on github.com/B23579/Sueza_project. These will usually require some knowledge of Markdown.
